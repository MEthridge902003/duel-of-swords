### Project Intent
This is a non-commercial, educational project created as part of my journey through **The Odin Project (TOP) Foundations**. It is a technical exercise in implementing a complex logic matrix and integrating AI (Google Gemini) into a web application.

The combat mechanics (the 9-move matrix) used in this project are based on the **"Duel of Swords"** game originally featured in the **Red Dragon Inn (RDI)** on America Online (AOL).
* I do not claim ownership of the "Duel of Swords" mechanics, names, or the Red Dragon Inn setting.
* This project is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by the original creators of the Red Dragon Inn or any current rights holders (such as Slugfest Games or Wizards of the Coast).
